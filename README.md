`
I developed this stock dashboard, to practice R in a simple UI, as a versatile tool designed for traders and investors to analyze stock market data efficiently. Built using R's Shiny framework and integrated with libraries like quantmod, moments, ggplot2, and DT, this dashboard provides an intuitive interface for data visualization and statistical analysis. 
`

## Features:
  - `Chart Builder:` Create customizable charts, including line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts. Incorporate Bollinger Bands for technical analysis.
  - `Data Exploration:` Explore historical stock data by entering ticker symbols and date ranges. Visualize data tables for deeper insights.
  - `Statistical Analysis:` Calculate key statistical metrics such as mean return, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis to assess risk and market behavior.
  - `User Interaction:` Receive real-time alerts and messages for enhanced user experience and important usage instructions.

## How to use it?
  1- Use (https://finance.yahoo.com/) to get the `ticker` of your firm (e.g. AMZN-TSLA-GOOG-NVDA-IBM) <br>
  2- After you get your ticker, enter your input here (https://iibrahemali.shinyapps.io/Stock-Dashboard/), and press `View` <br>
  3- Then, apply the changes you want to the chart, and use the specific data range you need <br>
  4- Moreover, you have the option to access some detailed data and stats  <br> <br>

Feel Free to fork or clone it.
